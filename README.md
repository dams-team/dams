Domain Adaptation for Multi-Label Speech (DAMS) explores zero-shot and fine-tuned models for detecting speech, music, noise, and overlapping events in WBOK radio broadcasts. The project evaluates pretrained audio encoders and uses pseudo-labeling to improve robustness in noisy, real-world conditions.
